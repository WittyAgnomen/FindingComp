    "#  Approach 3: Doc2Vec Similar Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will treat each description as a document and convert the words into an embedding and the firms themselves into a vector embedding. Then we will just look at the most similar other firm embeddinings using cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2vec (aka paragraph2vec, aka sentence embeddings) modifies the word2vec algorithm to unsupervised learning of continuous representations for larger blocks of text, such as sentences, paragraphs or entire documents. Note: distributed memory model is the default when running Doc2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm runs through the sentences iterator twice: once to build the vocab, and once to train the model on the input data, learning a vector representation for each word and for each label in the dataset. Here the input data is the the firm's description and the label is the the firm's name. \n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat of the way this algorithm runs is that, since the learning rate decrease over the course of iterating over the data, labels which are only seen in a single LabeledSentence during training will only be trained with a fixed learning rate. This frequently produces less than optimal results. To obtain better results we will iterate over the data several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on space complexity: With the current implementation, all label vectors are stored separately in RAM. In this case, a unique firm name per description, causes memory usage to grow linearly with the size of the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Similar in Doc2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the similarity of the firm, we use the Gensim's Doc2Vec built in 'most similar' function. This method computes cosine similarity between a simple mean of the projection weight vectors of the given docs. The default number of most similar returned by this function is 10 (topn=10)."
